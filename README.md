### Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales data across various products collected from multiple markets and stores within Nigeria’s four main regions. The analysis utilizes Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Pivot tables. The use of an interactive Power BI dashboard was used to  highlight key findings, presenting them in a user-friendly format that makes insights accessible and actionable. Overall, this project supports data-driven decision-making by providing a clear view of sales performance across Nigeria’s regions.

### Data Source
The data for this analysis was sourced from various point-of-sale systems across the four regions in Nigeria. The dataset includes the following:
1. Region: These are the geographical areas (north, south, east and west) where the different stores operate
2. Quantity: This is the amount or number of the products purchased
3. Unit Price: This is the price of each single product
4. Total Revenue: This is the total amount generated from the sales of each product
5. Date of Sale: This is the date on which a product was purchased
6. Model: This is the product model being sold

### Project Objectives
The primary objective is to uncover critical insights such as
- Total sales by Products
- Total sales by Region
- Total sales by Month
- Average sales per product 
- Identifying top-selling products
- Evaluating regional performance
- Tracking monthly sales trends

### Formula Used
1. Average Revenue = Total Revenue / Units Sold

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: For analysing the data
- Pivot Table: To organise, summarize and filter the data for easy interpretation
- Structured Query Language: For querying from databases
- Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards
